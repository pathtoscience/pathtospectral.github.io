# Path to Science

<p class="description" style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: var(--accent-primary); font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: -0.01em;">
    Evolving the AI landscape through mathematical rigor and stochastic mastery.
</p>

I am a research scientist specializing in the convergence of **stochastic control**, **dynamic systems**, and **generative artificial intelligence**. My mission is to architect the next generation of generative models—systems that are not merely predictive, but mathematically consistent, robust to uncertainty, and physically grounded.
