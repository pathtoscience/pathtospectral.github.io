# Path to Science

<p class="description" style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--accent-primary); font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    Advanced Research in Stochastic Analysis & Generative AI
</p>

I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of **stochastic control**, **mathematical physics**, and **machine learning**. My mission is to develop generative models that are theoretically grounded, robust to uncertainty, and physically consistent.
