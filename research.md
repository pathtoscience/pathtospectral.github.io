# Research Areas

My work lies at the intersection of stochastic analysis, control theory, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in how we can use mathematical guarantees to build safer and more robust AI systems.

## Stochastic Control

<div class="post-item">
<h3>Optimal Control in Uncertain Environments</h3>
<p>
Investigating optimal strategies for agents operating in highly uncertain and dynamic environments. This research focuses on deriving control laws that remain robust even when system dynamics are continuously changing or adversarial.

## Generative AI

<div class="post-item">
<h3>Physics-Informed Generative Models</h3>
<p>
Building the next generation of generative models that are not only expressive but also respect physical laws and mathematical constraints. We aim to make these black-box models more explainable and theoretically grounded.

## Scientific Visualization

<div class="post-item">
<h3>Web Technologies & Science</h3>
<p>
Exploring how modern web technologies (WebGL, WebGPU) can be leveraged to create providing intuitive, interactive visualizations for complex scientific data.
