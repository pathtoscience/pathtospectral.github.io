# Research Trajectory

My research is dedicated to building bridging the gap between classical mathematical analysis and modern deep learning. We build systems where safety and performance are provable.

    <span class="post-meta">Stochastic Control</span>
    <h3>Optimal Control & Uncertainty</h3>
    <p>
        Formulating new control laws for agents operating in non-stationary and highly uncertain environments. This work integrates HJB equations with deep reinforcement learning to provide robust decision-making frameworks.

    <span class="post-meta">Generative AI</span>
    <h3>Physics-Informed Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Architecting the next breed of generative models that inherently respect Maxwell's equations, fluid dynamics, and spectral symmetries. We move beyond data-fitting to true physical consistency.

    <h3>High-Performance Visualization</h3>
    <p>
        Developing custom kernels using WebGL and WebGPU to provide real-time, interactive exploration of high-dimensional manifold data.
